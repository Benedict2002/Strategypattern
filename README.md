# Strategypattern

, an
abstract class (known as the template) provides a skeletal implementation
of each public method, and relies on nonpublic abstract methods to
provide the implementation-specific details. These abstract methods
get implemented by the template subclasses. Each subclass is called a
strategy class because it provides a particular strategy for implementing the
templateâ€™s abstract methods.
